`These are more like notes than write-up!` I wrote them when I was solving machines from htb. 
These notes were a result of me googling a shit ton of info, trying to reach root-level access (total pwnage). As a result, I wrote whatever was in my mind (well, mostly) during that time.


You can use my notes/writeup to point you in the right direction, but there might be gaps here and there, which can only be fixed if ***YOU DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH***.

That is why it is not maintained like a regular professional **Writeup**.
