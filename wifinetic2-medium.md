nmap : 
	22, 8080

`<ip>:8080` leads to a OpenPLC login page .   `here <ip. refers to the htb machine ip`.

Googling default creds for OpenPLC login page bear fruit.

I now have access to a dashboard.
Googling here , there is a Authenticated RCE . (exploitDB)

Just edit a line inside the exploit file:
`compile_program = options.url + '/compile-program?file=blank_program.st'`

"blank_program.st" will be the program's name that was mentioned in the dashboard/webGUI , so we I had to edit the exploit file accordingly. (after enum.)

After getting the rev shell, we can get the user flag.

Since the name is Wifinetic, it surely has something to do with wifis.

***WPS Pixie Dust attack*** can be of help here.
(from google:
`Wi-Fi Protected SetupÂ (WPS) was introduced in 2006 for home users who wanted to connect to their home network without the trouble of remembering complex passwords for the Wi-Fi. It used an eight digit pin to authenticate a client to the network. A pixie dust attack is a way of brute forcing the eight digit pin. This attack allowed the recovery of the pin within minutes if the router was vulnerable. On the other hand, a simple brute force would have taken hours. In this recipe, you will learn how to perform a pixie dust attack.`)


There is a tool for this attack: `oneshot.py`
from the github: 
```
Show avaliable networks and start Pixie Dust attack on a specified network:
sudo python3 oneshot.py -i wlan0 -K
```
then, follow the instructions and provide the bssid

We get the passkey of the wifi:
`NoWWEDoKnowWhaTisReal123!`

Now we need the ip for wlan0
follow dis:  https://wiki.somlabs.com/index.php/Connecting_to_WiFi_network_using_systemd_and_wpa-supplicant

then do this
 ```
 wpa_passphrase plcrouter 'NoWWEDoKnowWhaTisReal123!' > config
 wpa_supplicant -B -c config -i wlan0
 ifconfig wlan0 192.168.1.7 netmask 255.255.255.0
 ssh root@192.168.1.1
 cat root.txt
```

Pwnd!
